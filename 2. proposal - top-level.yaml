Notes: 
  These sections are moved under the top level Cosmos DB TOC:
    - Overview
    - Concepts (without Multi-model APIs)
      - Multi-model APIs will be the "Overview" of the subpages.
    - How To Guides > Manage (then renamed Manageability)
      - Extract Security from "How To Guides > Manage", then make it a top level item
      - Extract items under "How To Guides > Manage > Security", then put them under new "Security" top level item.
    - Moved everything under "How To Guides > Integrate", then renamed as "Integrations".
    - Moved entire Resources menu, and included the "Code samples" item from "Reference > Code Samples" and renamed it "Azure Code Samples repository"
