Notes: 
- The 5 - Develop locally, and 6 - Integrate with functions sections need their own specific Graph focus.
- Currently no "Reference" articles specific for Graph (maybe we can link to external documentation of recommended drivers?)
- We need more samples for Graph API for the section - this is beyond the scope of this exercise.
